Project Overview:
This Jupyter Notebook project leverages the powerful XGBoost algorithm to predict house prices. By effectively utilizing a dataset containing various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc., the model aims to accurately estimate house prices.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is housedata.csv

Data Preprocessing:
The following data preprocessing steps were performed:
1.	Handling Missing Values: Missing values were addressed using appropriate techniques like imputation or removal.
2.	Feature Engineering: New features were created or existing ones were transformed to enhance model performance.
3.	Data Cleaning: Outliers were identified and handled, and inconsistent data was corrected.
4.	Feature Scaling: Numerical features were scaled to a common range to ensure fair comparison.

Model Development:
An XGBoost regression model was implemented and tuned to optimize its performance. The key steps involved:
1.	Model Initialization: An XGBoost regressor was initialized with default parameters.
2.	Hyperparameter Tuning: A grid search or randomized search approach was used to identify the optimal hyperparameters, such as learning rate, maximum depth, number of estimators, etc.
3.	Model Training: The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset using the selected hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of the XGBoost model was assessed using the following metrics:
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing a more interpretable error metric.   
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
•	R-squared: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.

Results and Insights:
The XGBoost model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an R-squared value of [R-squared value]. This indicates that the model can accurately predict house prices based on the given features.
